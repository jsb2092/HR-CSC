# Description
This is a command line application which given a properly formatted cabrillo file, will 
calculator your contest score after asking a few questions

# Testing
This was written primarily for calculating the score for the 2018 FT8 Roundup.  It is possible
that it can be used for other contests, but there is no error checking currently built in

# Acknowledgements
I am using https://github.com/dh1tw/DX-Cluster-Parser in order to determine the country that a 
DX Cluser is from.  Many thanks

# Installation
This requires python 3.  Download the files and run python3 calc.py.  You will be prompted
to answer some questions regarding how to score.  There are 2 sample Cabrillo files provided
from the 2018 FT8 Roundup (K2NP and W2JSB)
