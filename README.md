# Description
This is a command line application which given a properly formatted cabrillo file, will 
calculator your contest score after asking a few questions

# Testing
This was written primarily for calculating the score for the 2018 FT8 Roundup.  It is possible
that it can be used for other contests, but there is no error checking currently built in
